# Coding Problems

This is a list of generic coding problems I find usefull to practice with.

Its just a compilation of problems I find on internet. If you know a better answer or an answer in another language other than JS, feel free to do a Pull-Request to add it on the file with a comment and dont forget to add the test to it plz.

Expect more to come with time.

## Problem 1

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
